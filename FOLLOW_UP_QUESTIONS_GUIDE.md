# Follow-up Questions Guide

## Quick Reference

Your NFL chatbot now remembers your conversation! Here's how to use follow-up questions:

## ‚úÖ What Works

### Using Pronouns
```
You: Tell me about Patrick Mahomes' stats
Bot: [provides stats]

You: How many touchdowns did he throw?
     ‚úì "he" automatically refers to Patrick Mahomes
```

### Continuing Topics
```
You: Show me Travis Kelce's receiving yards in 2024
Bot: [provides yards]

You: What about his touchdowns?
     ‚úì Continues with Travis Kelce and 2024 season
```

### Comparing Players
```

```

### Week Progression
```

```

## üí° Tips

2. **Use "he", "his", "them"** - Pronouns work great
3. **Build on previous questions** - Each answer provides context for the next
4. **Don't repeat yourself** - The bot remembers what you just asked

## ‚ùì When to Be Specific

- The context might be unclear

```
You: Compare Mahomes and Allen
Bot: [comparison]

You: What about Burrow?  ‚Üê Unclear: compare to who?
Better: Compare Burrow to Mahomes
```

## üöÄ Try It Out!

Start a conversation and see how natural it feels:

1. Ask about a player's stats
2. Follow up with "How many touchdowns?"
3. Ask "What about last season?"
4. Try "Compare him to [another player]"

The bot will understand and maintain context throughout!
