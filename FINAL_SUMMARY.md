- **Cached Queries**: ~1.5-2 seconds
- **Repeated Queries**: <100ms (instant)
- **Cache Hit Rate**: >80% after warmup

## 🎓 How It Works

### Data Source Routing
```
User Query → Query Parser → Retriever Node
                              ↓
                    ┌─────────┴─────────┐
                    ↓                   ↓
            Current Season (2024)   Historical (1999-2023)
                    ↓                   ↓
            1. nflreadpy           1. Kaggle
            2. ESPN API            2. nflreadpy
            3. Kaggle              3. ESPN API
```

### Caching Strategy
```
Query → Check Query Cache (1hr TTL)
         ↓ miss
         Check NFLReadPy Cache (24hr TTL)
         ↓ miss
         Fetch from nflreadpy API
         ↓
         Cache & Return
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue**: "No module named 'pyarrow'"
```bash
pip install pyarrow
```

**Issue**: "Player not found"
- Use full names: "Patrick Mahomes" not "Mahomes"
- Check spelling
- Verify player played in 2024

**Issue**: Slow first query
- Expected behavior (loads full season data)
- Subsequent queries are much faster

**Issue**: Missing statistics
- Check if stat is relevant for player position
- QBs won't have receiving_yards, etc.
