# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The NFL Player Performance Chatbot is a conversational AI system that enables users to query, analyze, and compare NFL player statistics through natural language interactions. The system uses Chainlit for the web-based chat interface and LangGraph to orchestrate a multi-node workflow that parses queries, retrieves relevant data, generates insights, and maintains conversation context across multiple turns.

## Glossary

- **Chatbot System**: The complete LangGraph-based application that processes user queries about NFL player statistics
- **Chainlit Interface**: The web-based user interface framework that provides the chat UI and handles user interactions
- **LangGraph Workflow**: The state machine orchestrating the multi-node processing pipeline
- **Query Parser Node**: The LangGraph node responsible for converting natural language questions into structured data queries
- **Retriever Node**: The LangGraph node that fetches relevant player statistics from the data sources
- **LLM Node**: The LangGraph node that generates natural language insights from retrieved data
- **Memory Node**: The LangGraph node that maintains conversation context across multiple user interactions
- **Data Layer**: The component that manages access to NFL statistics datasets including Kaggle, ESPN API, and nflreadpy sources
- **User**: The person interacting with the chatbot to obtain NFL player statistics and insights

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a User, I want to ask natural language questions about NFL player statistics through a web interface, so that I can quickly obtain insights without writing SQL queries or code

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the User submits a natural language question about player statistics, THE Chainlit Interface SHALL accept text input containing the question
2. THE Chatbot System SHALL support questions about yards, targets, EPA, completion rates, and other standard NFL statistics
3. WHEN the User asks about player performance metrics, THE Chatbot System SHALL return a natural language response within 10 seconds
4. THE Chatbot System SHALL handle questions about individual players, team statistics, and league-wide trends
5. IF the User submits an ambiguous question, THEN THE Chatbot System SHALL request clarification before processing

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a User, I want to compare multiple players across different metrics, so that I can make informed decisions about player performance

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the User requests a comparison between two or more players, THE Chatbot System SHALL retrieve statistics for all specified players
2. THE Chatbot System SHALL support comparisons across multiple statistical categories simultaneously
3. WHEN generating comparison insights, THE LLM Node SHALL highlight significant differences between players with percentage changes or absolute values
4. THE Chatbot System SHALL support comparisons across different time periods including seasons, games, or career totals
5. WHEN comparing players, THE Chatbot System SHALL present results in a clear, structured format

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a User, I want the chatbot to remember previous questions in our conversation, so that I can ask follow-up questions without repeating context

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the User asks a follow-up question referencing a previous query, THE Memory Node SHALL retrieve relevant conversation history
2. THE Memory Node SHALL maintain context for at least the previous 10 conversational turns
3. WHEN processing a new query, THE Query Parser Node SHALL access conversation context from the Memory Node
4. THE Chatbot System SHALL resolve pronouns and references to previously mentioned players using conversation history
5. WHEN starting a new conversation session, THE Memory Node SHALL initialize with empty context

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a User, I want to access both historical and current season NFL statistics, so that I can analyze trends and recent performance

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Data Layer SHALL provide access to NFL player statistics from 1999 to 2023 via the Kaggle dataset
2. THE Data Layer SHALL integrate with nflreadpy data sources for current season statistics
3. WHEN the User queries recent statistics, THE Retriever Node SHALL fetch data from the appropriate data source based on the time period
4. THE Data Layer SHALL update current season statistics at least once per day during the NFL season
5. IF a requested statistic is unavailable for a specified time period, THEN THE Chatbot System SHALL inform the User of the data limitation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a User, I want to receive contextual insights about player performance, so that I can understand the significance of the statistics

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating responses, THE LLM Node SHALL provide context such as league averages, rankings, or historical comparisons
2. THE LLM Node SHALL identify and highlight notable trends in player performance data
3. WHEN relevant, THE LLM Node SHALL include situational statistics such as performance under pressure or in specific game conditions
4. THE Chatbot System SHALL generate insights that explain why certain statistics are significant
5. THE LLM Node SHALL cite specific data points when making claims about player performance

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a User, I want the system to accurately parse my questions into data queries, so that I receive relevant results

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the User submits a question, THE Query Parser Node SHALL extract player names, statistical categories, and time periods
2. THE Query Parser Node SHALL convert natural language queries into structured filters for the Retriever Node
3. WHEN multiple interpretations are possible, THE Query Parser Node SHALL select the most likely interpretation based on context
4. THE Query Parser Node SHALL handle common variations in player name spelling and team references
5. IF the Query Parser Node cannot confidently parse a question, THEN THE Chatbot System SHALL request clarification from the User

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a User, I want the chatbot to handle errors gracefully, so that I can continue my analysis even when issues occur

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. IF a data source is unavailable, THEN THE Chatbot System SHALL attempt to retrieve data from alternative sources
2. WHEN an error occurs during query processing, THE Chatbot System SHALL provide a clear error message to the User
3. THE Chatbot System SHALL log all errors with sufficient detail for debugging
4. IF the Retriever Node returns no results, THEN THE Chatbot System SHALL suggest alternative queries to the User
5. THE Chatbot System SHALL continue operating for subsequent queries after encountering an error


### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a User, I want to interact with the chatbot through an intuitive web interface, so that I can easily access the system from any browser

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Chainlit Interface SHALL provide a web-based chat UI accessible through a browser
2. WHEN the User sends a message, THE Chainlit Interface SHALL display the message in the chat history immediately
3. THE Chainlit Interface SHALL stream responses from the LangGraph Workflow to the User in real-time
4. THE Chainlit Interface SHALL maintain chat history visibility throughout the session
5. THE Chainlit Interface SHALL provide visual indicators when the Chatbot System is processing a query
