## Troubleshooting

**Missing pyarrow dependency?**
```bash
pip install pyarrow
```

**Player not found?**
- Use full names: "Patrick Mahomes" not "Mahomes"
- Check spelling
- Verify player played in 2024

**Slow first query?**
- Expected behavior (loads full season data)
- Subsequent queries are much faster
